I want to make an app for me and my friends to bet on IIHF2025.
User gets 3 points for guessing the exact result, 1 points for guessing winner of the match and 2 points for guessing draw.
App will have also scoreboard.
We will not bet anything, user just get points for right guesses.

Models:
    -Match or GameMatch
    -Prediction
    -Score

Migrations:
    -matches_table
    -predictions_table
    -scores_table

Features:
    -Leaderboard
    -User can bet only before the match starts
    -User can see others predictions ???
    -User can bet exact score prediction (3 points for right guess)
    -User can pick winner (1 point) or draw (2 points)
    -

**Plan for Developing the IIHF 2025 Match Predictions Application**

1. **Database and Migrations**
   - Create a "matches" table with columns: (id, home_team, away_team, start_time, final_home_score, final_away_score).
   - Create a "predictions" table with columns: (id, user_id, match_id, predicted_home_score, predicted_away_score).
   - Update or confirm "users" table; ensure it supports relationships with predictions (id, name, email, password, etc.).
   - Create a "scoreboard" table or a "scores" table with columns: (id, user_id, points).

2. **Models and Relationships**
   - Define a "Match" model that has relationships to "Predictions."
   - Define a "Prediction" model that belongs to a "User" and a "Match."
   - Define or extend "User" model to relate to "Predictions" and "Scoreboard."
   - Define a "Score/Scoreboard" model if separate from the "User" model.

3. **User Authentication**
   - Configure Laravel's built-in auth scaffolding (register, login, logout, password reset).
   - Implement middleware to ensure authenticated users can make predictions.

4. **Match Management**
   - Create a dedicated controller (e.g., MatchesController) for managing matches (CRUD).
   - Set up routes for:
     • GET /matches (index)
     • GET /matches/{id} (show)
     • POST /matches (store)
     • PUT/PATCH /matches/{id} (update)
     • DELETE /matches/{id} (destroy)
   - Restrict match creation/updates to admins or authorized users.

5. **Prediction Management**
   - Create a PredictionsController with actions to create and update predictions.
   - Ensure predictions are only accepted before the match "start_time."
   - Store predicted scores in "predicted_home_score" and "predicted_away_score."

6. **Points Calculation Logic**
   - After each match final score is entered:
     1. Award 3 points if the user predicted the exact score.
     2. Award 2 points if the user correctly predicted a draw.
     3. Award 1 point if the user correctly predicted the winning team.
   - Implement a service or job to run after match finalization to compute points and update the scoreboard.

7. **Scoreboard/Leaderboard**
   - Create a route (e.g., GET /scoreboard) and corresponding view to display user scores in descending order.
   - Optionally cache the scoreboard for performance.

8. **Frontend & Blade Templates**
   - Use Blade templates for match listing, prediction forms, scoreboard, and user authentication pages.
   - Plug in TypeScript for any dynamic functionalities (form validations, scoreboard auto-refresh, etc.).
   - Keep the design simple and user-friendly.

9. **Configuration & Deployment**
   - Use SQLite database as specified in the .env file.
   - Enable database session handling in config/session.php.
   - Test all routes, controllers, and business logic locally before deployment.

10. **Testing & Validation**
   - Write unit tests for match creation, prediction submission, points calculation, and scoreboard display.
   - Validate user inputs (scores, match times) to avoid invalid data.

**Ordering & Implementation Tips**
- Start by creating migrations and models, then set up basic authentication.
- Incrementally add the Match CRUD and test the workflow.
- Use feature tests to ensure each part of the system is operating correctly.
- Finally, polish the user interface and add TypeScript enhancements.



predictions table:
1. user_id as a foreign key referencing the users table
2. match_id as a foreign key referencing the matches table
3. predicted_home_score and predicted_away_score as integers
4. A unique constraint on the combination of user_id and match_id to ensure a user can only have one prediction per match

scores table:
1. user_id as a foreign key referencing the users table
2. total_points as an integer with a default of 0
3. exact_score_count as an integer with a default of 0
4. correct_draw_count as an integer with a default of 0
5. correct_winner_count as an integer with a default of 0
6. A unique constraint on user_id to ensure each user has only one score record



**Plan for Creating the Laravel-based IIHF 2025 Betting Application**

1. **Set Up Database Tables**
   • Generate migrations for matches (id, home_team, away_team, start_time, final_home_score, final_away_score), predictions (id, user_id, match_id, predicted_home_score, predicted_away_score), and scores (id, user_id, total_points, exact_score_count, correct_draw_count, correct_winner_count).
   • Add the unique constraints on [user_id, match_id] in predictions and on user_id in scores.
   • Use Laravel’s migration and model factories (if needed) for structured data creation.

2. **Create Eloquent Models**
   • Implement Match, Prediction, and Score models.
   • Set up the appropriate relationships (e.g., a Prediction belongs to a User and a Match, a Score belongs to a User).

3. **Implement Match Management**
   • Create a MatchesController for CRUD operations on matches.
   • Handle final score updates, ensuring real-time synchronization with the leaderboard.

4. **Build Prediction System**
   • Develop a PredictionsController to handle user predictions.
   • Ensure validations (non-negative scores, submission only before match start_time).
   • Add routes that restrict predictions once a match has started.

5. **Automated Points Calculation**
   • Write a service or observer to trigger points update after match final scores are recorded.
   • Use the logic:
     • 3 points for exact match score,
     • 2 points for correct draw prediction,
     • 1 point for correct winner.

6. **Implement Leaderboard and Real-Time Updates**
   • Create a ScoreboardController or use a component to display user standings.
   • Integrate Laravel Echo or a similar websocket strategy to update match scores and leaderboard in real time.

7. **Frontend with Inertia.js and Vue.js**
   • Build Vue components for Match Management, Prediction Submission, and Leaderboard.
   • Implement forms for new/edit predictions, ensuring user-friendly validation messages.
   • Use dynamic updates for real-time scoreboard changes.

8. **User Authentication and Security**
   • Leverage existing authentication scaffolding.
   • Restrict routes based on user roles (e.g., admin for match management).
   • Secure endpoints for predictions and scoreboard.

9. **Error Handling & Testing**
   • Use try-catch blocks in controllers for robust error handling.
   • Write unit tests (models, controllers) and integration tests for critical flows (predictions, points calculation).

10. **Deployment & Final Checks**
    • Configure environment for websockets (Echo, Pusher, or similar).
    • Verify concurrency requirements (e.g., limited editing, no data race conditions).
    • Optimize database queries and ensure application security with Laravel’s best practices.
